Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712). Obvious decreasing of the stocks for all the continental native distribution area (Ref. 40476). Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; can be fried, boiled and baked (Ref. 9988).

The northwest Atlantic stock migrates from Newfoundland, Canada in the winter to Massachusetts in the summer (Ref. 43278, 88754). Trans-Atlantic migrations have also been recorded.

Occurs singly, in pairs or groups of 3 or more, or in huge schools (group of up to 100 individuals has been reported) (Ref. 6871, 43278). Prefers water temperature between 8-16 °C (Ref. 88171). Makes extensive horizontal and vertical movements along the continental shelf and shelf edge to utilize productive feeding areas (Ref. 50200). During the summer months, it is found near the surface of boreal to warm-temperate areas (Ref. 43278) feeding on zooplankton by filtering (Ref. 88781). Found in deeper waters during winter (Ref. 6871, 50200, 58302). Undertakes long transoceanic migrations (e.g. from the British Isles to Newfoundland, Canada (Ref. 88824)) and moves between the northern and southern hemisphere in tropical mesopelagic water (Ref. 88825).

Inhabits steep rocky shores, sheltering in caves during the day (Ref. 38425), with as much as 14 individuals in a single cave (Ref. 38426).  Foraging singly over open substrate at night (Ref. 38426), it drifts passively with the current or swims slowly with its paired fins and its second dorsal and anal fins (Ref. 38427).  May travel as much as 8 km at night searching for food and retreats to the nearest cave before dawn (Ref. 38426).  Preys on fishes and squid (Ref. 26162).  <i>Beryx</i>, <i>Polymixia</i>, <i>Symphysanodon</i>, apogonids, a skate, an eel and a swell shark have been known to be eaten (Ref. 11228).  Its main enemies are likely to be large sharks (Ref. 26162).  Ovoviviparous, with as much as 5-29 young (Ref. 11228, 37171).  Gestation period estimated at 3 years, which would be the longest known in vertebrates (Ref. 30865).  A small relative gill area (Ref. 38428) restricts coelacanths to a life 'in the slow lane', drift-feeding at night in cold waters and resting in slightly warmer caves for food consumption during day time (Ref. 38429).  Recently, Prof Hans Fricke and associates have succeeded in observing and filming Latimeria in their natural habitat.  Using a two-man submersible, Fricke found several coelacanths in depths of 120-400 m on the barren lava slopes off Grand Comoro.  Coelacanths have distinctive white markings, and this allowed recognition of individuals and tracking of their movements.  During the day, Latimeria retreat to caves, with as many as 13 fish crowded together in a single cave.  Several individuals occupy overlapping home ranges, and Fricke never saw any aggressive encounters between coelacanths.  By resting in caves (were there are no strong currents) the coelacanths save energy and avoid encounters with large predators (deep-water sharks).  After sunset, the coelacanths leave their caves and drift slowly across the substrate, presumably looking for food, within 1-3 meters of the bottom.  On these nightly hunting forays, the coelacanth may travel as much as 8 km; and before dawn they shelter in the nearest cave.  While searching for prey, or moving from one cave to another, Latimeria appears to move in slow motion, either drifting passively with the current and using its flexible pectoral and pelvic fins to adjust its position, or slowly swimming by a synchronous sculling movement of the second dorsal and anal fins.  In slow forward swimming, the left pectoral and right pelvic fins move forward, while the right pectoral and left pelvic fins are pulled backward.  This tandem movement of alternate paired fins resembles the movement of the forelimbs and hindlimbs of a tetrapod walking on land.  Latimeria does not use its lobed fins for walking on the bottom, and even when they are resting in caves they usually do not touch the substrate.  Like most slow moving fishes, the coelacanth can make a sudden lunge or fast start by means of a quick flip of its massive caudal fin.  During its nightly foraging swims, Latimeria was often seen to perform head-stands, in which it rotates its body into a vertical position, with its head near the bottom and its caudal fin curved perpendicular to its body.  It then held this position for two or three minutes at a time.  This curious behavior may be used when it is scanning the bottom with its putative electoreceptive rostral organ, or it may be a reaction to the bright lights of Prof.  Fricke's submersible (Ref. 38228).",NA,1.2539,0,2,"1991-01-18T00:00:00.000Z",113,"2009-11-18T00:00:00.000Z",1,"1994-01-28T00:00:00.000Z",NA,2063

Spawns in winter (late December-early February) in big riverine deltas over sand and gravel substrate with water current of 1.3 m/sec (Ref. 6459).  Undertakes spawning and trophic migrations in the Mekong basin.  Trophic migrations occurs throughout its occurrence range which takes place mainly at the onset of the flood season and are mainly undertaken by juveniles and subadults (Ref. 37770).  Upstream spawning migrations take place between October and February from Kompong Cham in Cambodia to Chiang Khong in Thailand.  At Chiang Khong , fishermen reported that <i>Probarbus</i> moves up the tributary Nam Ta in Laos to breed in March-April.  Three <i>Probarbus</i> species were also reported to migrate together, but spawn separately, in January-February at Sungkom, Nong Khai Province in Thailand (Ref. 37770).  Egg is buoyant, yellow and 2 mm in diameter.  Hatching occurs in 32 hrs at 23°C (Ref. 6459).

May be caught individually or in small numbers of any size incidentally with gillnetting and other fishing activities, at virtually any time or place in the Mekong mainstream (Ref. 10431), but mostly caught during November-January spawning migration, when it is by far the most important species in fisheries catch (Ref. 12369).  In the Mekong this important fisheries species is under serious long-term decline and this decline evidently is basin wide and the most obvious (but not necessarily only) reason is overfishing with gillnets during the reproductive migrations and spawning periods (Ref. 10431).
